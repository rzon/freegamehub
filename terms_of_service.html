anything of monetary value. Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are provided solely for your enjoyment of the
Software. All sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency by us to you are final.</p>
<p>You will not trade, sell, gift, transfer or lend Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency (a “Virtual Transaction”),
except as permitted in accordance with the Instructions. Where the Instructions permit you to engage in
Virtual Transactions any transactions are between you and the other relevant parties. We have no
responsibility for any Virtual Transactions, redemptions or refunds of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual
Currency. We are not responsible for any claims brought against you in relation to your use of the Virtual
Goods and/or Virtual Currency, relating to any Virtual Transactions you enter into or are alleged to have
entered into.</p>
<p>We may require you to comply with specific policies applicable to the purchase and use of Virtual Goods and
Virtual Currency and we may change these policies from time to time. All such policies will form part of
this EULA. We may modify or eliminate Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Currency from some or all Software at any
time, with or without notice. We will have no liability to you in the event that we exercise these rights.
If we close Your Account, terminate your access to the Software, or terminate this EULA, you will forfeit
all Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, and we will have no liability to you for that forfeiture.</p>

relevant laws relating to the import, export and re-export of the Licensed Items and, in particular, will

<p>The License granted to you under this EULA will commence on the earlier of the date that you: (i) accept the
terms and conditions of the EULA; or (ii) download, copy, install, access or use any Licensed Items. The
License will expire with respect to each Licensed Item on the date upon which you dispose of the Licensed
Item or the termination date, if terminated by us, as set out below.</p>
<p>We may suspend your access to or use of any Licensed Item or terminate this EULA if:</p>
<p>(1)we reasonably believe that you have breached any term or condition of this EULA;</p>

third party claims against us or is potentially damaging to our reputation;</p>

more consecutive months from the date and time of last recorded access and/or use on our servers;</p>
<p>(6)where we cease to support that Licensed Item; or</p>
<p>(7)for any other reason, such as (a) there is a regulatory or statutory change limiting our ability to
provide such part of the Licensed Items or the Services, and (b) any event (such as a technical difficulty,
capacity problem or communications failure) beyond our reasonable control prevents us from continuing to
provide such part of the Licensed Items or the Services.</p>
<p>Where you have paid any subscription fee in relation to a Licensed Item and we terminate this EULA in
relation to that Licensed Item under paragraphs (6) or (7) in circumstances not due to any act or omission
or breach of this EULA by you or not due to any applicable laws or regulations, we will (i) refund a
pro-rata proportion of any subscription fees already paid by you at the time of termination, or (ii) provide
other form of compensation to you, as permitted by the applicable laws. Where reasonably practicable, we
will give you notice of any suspension or termination.</p>

immediately permanently delete all copies of the Licensed Item to which the expiry or termination relates
and you will immediately cease accessing and using any Software and Services relating to that Licensed Item.

you regularly back up data, information, media and other content.</p>
<p class="title">YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS</p>
<p>Nothing in this EULA is intended to replace or supersede your rights under any mandatory applicable laws and
regulations, and such mandatory rights of yours will apply to the extent they are inconsistent with any
terms in this EULA.</p>
<p class="title">GENERAL</p>
<p>This EULA (including the Privacy Policy and the Instructions) is the entire agreement between you and us in
relation to our Services. You agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not
explicitly set out in this EULA. The invalidity of any provision of this EULA (or parts of any provision)
will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that
provision). If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of this EULA as drafted, we may replace those
terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing
the remaining terms of this EULA. No delay in enforcing any provision of this EULA will be construed to be a
waiver of any rights under that provision. Any rights and obligations under this EULA which by their nature
should survive, including but not limited to any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities
(if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of this
EULA.</p>
<p>No person other than you and us will (subject to any applicable laws and regulations) have any right to
enforce this EULA against any person, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer this EULA or any rights
or obligations under this EULA, without our prior consent. We may freely assign, transfer or sub-contract
this EULA or our rights and obligations under this EULA, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or
notice. You acknowledge and agree that in no event will our partners or Affiliates have any liability under
this EULA.</p>
<p class="title">GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<p>Except to the extent that the applicable laws and regulations of your jurisdiction mandate otherwise (for
instance, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in
a local court (including small claims court (or similar court)), this EULA and any dispute or claim arising
out of or in connection with this EULA will be governed by the law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, relating
to, or in connection with this EULA, including but not limited to their existence, validity, interpretation,
performance, breach or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by
the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre under the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre
Administered Arbitration rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the
arbitration will be Hong Kong. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings will be
conducted in Chinese.</p>
